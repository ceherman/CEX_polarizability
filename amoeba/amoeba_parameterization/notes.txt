I installed tinker, psi4, poltype2, and openmm
(I needed OpenMM 7.7+ to make CUDA work on my laptop)

I generated .sdf files from SMILES strings for the species of interest
(with the help of hack-a-mol https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/hackamol.htm)

I ran workflow_a for directory setup
I ran poltype2 with workflow_b

I modified the atom/group numbers in the final.key and final.xyz outputs from poltype2
manually after running workflow_b
(i.e. I left acetate's numbers as 401+, I changed esna's to 411+, etc.)

(this was because I encountered problems with the poltype2 input trying specify these values
for reference, search the poltype python script for 401 - this is the 
starting number parameter for the atom/group numbers
I used %s/401/451/g in vi, for example, to change the numbers post hoc
I probably should have re-labeled the atoms in .sdf files before running poltype2 - i.e.
after running hack-a-mol to get the .sdf files)

I ran workflow_d to append the generated AMOEBA parameters to amoebabio18_mod.prm
(i.e. amoebabio18.prm copied from the tinker installation)

After workflow_d, I downloaded processTinkerForceField.py and residuesFinal.xml from
https://github.com/openmm/openmm/tree/master/devtools/forcefield-scripts

python processTinkerForceField_mod.py amoebabio18_mod.prm

(processTinkerForceField_mod.py was modified to remove vdwpwr, as this was 
throwing errors and isn't believed to be relevant to my system
I left the vdwpr / Class pair entries out of the .xml file for now.
The _gk.xml file is for the Generalized Kirkwood imiplicit solvation model - 
ignore this.
The AMOEBA-BIO-2018.xml file is what we're after - I copied this to
AMOEBA-BIO-2018_residues.xml before editing it manually.)

I added residue entries to the AMOEBA-BIO-2018_residues.xml file manually
(There are entries for each atom and each bond
The atoms are named according to the CHARMM topology / rtf file naming convention 
to enable use of the .pdb files that I have from the GROMACS runs)

I copied residues.xml to residues_mod.xml (from the openmm installation
at ~/psi4conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/openmm/app/data/residues.xml)
and I added residue entries to it as well
(this is an annoying redundancy in openmm) 

I copied AMOEBA-BIO-2018_residues.xml and residues_mod.xml to the appropriate locations
for openmm using workflow_f. Note that I renamed residues_mod.xml to residues.xml
while copying because I don't know how to specify a different residues.xml file to
openmm (like we specify the parameter file). This is dangerous because residues.xml will
be overwritten anytime OpenMM is upgraded, so keep a copy of residues_mod.xml available.

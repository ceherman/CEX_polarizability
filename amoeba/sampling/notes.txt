The .pdb files came from the original packmol setup of systems for GROMACS sampling,
aside from esna_mamm, for which I used the file after NVT equilibration in GROMACS
(because the packmol generated system was having problems in minimization), and 
the following line was added to the pdb files manually:
CRYST1   42.000   42.000   42.000  90.00  90.00  90.00 P 1           1

Instructions
1. Run workflow_a to copy a fresh version of job_template.qs into all directories
2. Rename job_template.qs to job_<iteration-number>.qs and modify it as needed
3. sbatch job_<iteration-number>.qs

Prioritizing acet_guan and esna_guan 
0 - equilibrating for 0.2 ns
1 - simulate for 10 ns
2 - tentatively running for 25 ns more (with data saving every 100 steps)

(I changed the data saving frequency to every 100 steps)
Everything else - started running in the idle partition
0 - equilibrated for 0.2 ns
1 - tentatively running for 25 ns

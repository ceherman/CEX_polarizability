CHARMM FF download from https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml
    tar -xvf toppar_c36_jul22.tgz
    mv toppar toppar_c36_jul22

    I manually split the toppar_water_ions.str file into ch_top_water_ions.rtf and 
    ch_par_water_ions.prm files and commented out charmm engine comands in ch_par_water_ions.prm

    (Note to self - .rtf topology files are needed for psfgen, .prm parameter files are needed 
    for namd, .str "toppar" stream files contain both the topology and parameters but psfgen and namd
    may not be able to use them directly due to charmm engine commands)

    Shows that all .prm files are needed to use the cgenff .prm file
